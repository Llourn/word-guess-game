## Installation

This app is using an api call from https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword to generate the random word. If you want to run this app using the API Ninja's random word API you'll need to obtain an api key.

Once you have the API key you can create an env.js file in the assets folder with the contents `export const RANDOM_WORD_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";`. Then just run the `index.html` file in your browser.
